# Exercise Ricomida
Introduction to jQuery: the purpose of this exercise is to practice acquired skills regarding HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and introduce jQuery.  

This exercise consists of the construction of a web page related to the preparation of meals and recipe sample, the whole site should be built with responsive features, starting from a mock-up with its style guide.

The HTML was developed from zero as well as  the indicated CSS styles, which were complemented with Bootstrap elements and components to further enhance the style and allowed the site to adapt to any device (tablet, mobile, among others). On top of that, it was added special Bootstrap components that require the incorporation of jQuery, as in the case of Tooltips, and some interactions that are triggered by user-triggered events.
