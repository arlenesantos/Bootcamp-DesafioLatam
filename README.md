| Module  | Program | Description |  Projects |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Module 1   | Web Development Fundamentals | Web Development Fundamentals is an introductory module that provides the basic tools for web development. It covers building of basic web pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript according to industry best practices. In addition, it covers the creation and manipulation of files and directories in the terminal, uses GIT to control project versions, Github to backup the code and Github Pages to upload a web page.|[1.

| Module 2   | Basic JavaScript Programming | The basic JavaScript programming module provides the basic tools and knowledge to create programs from scratch. Build flowcharts and pseudocodes to represent algorithms; recognize the concepts of flow control, logical operators, data types, variables, conditionals, loops and iterating, functions (ES5) and arrow functions (ES6), arrays, objects, selection and manipulation of DOM elements, and apply basic regular expressions on strings to validate the structure of the information received. In addition, it covers how to make a request to a REST API using AJAX, process the result adding information to the DOM, and using CanvasJs library to make interactive graphics and add functionality to the page. |[8. Superhero](https://github.com/arlenesantos/Bootcamp-Projects/tree/main/08_SuperHero)|
| Module 3   | Advanced JavaScript Programming | This module addresses some features of ES6. Coding low/medium complexity pieces of software in JavaScript language using object-oriented paradigms. Key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are applied such as UML diagram, inheritance, closures, polymorphism, and abstraction. It includes the concept of asynchrony and the operation of the JavaScript engine to better understand how it handles the execution of tasks. Also, application of asynchronous functions using callbacks, promises and async / await, error handling and quering external data sources or APIs.|[9.

| Module 4  | Web Application Development | In the Web Application Development module, the JSON Web Token (JWT) security standard and its structure are presented, in order to use it to access protected resources in an API. Later in the project, a website is built, which main focus is to consume information from different APIs and display it in graphs and tables. The work environment is a project made with JavaScript in Node.js, which allows it to generate a real work environment, where the Front of the application consumes the APIs through AJAX with JavaScript or jQuery and maintains user authentication by storing the JWT. This project was developed in group and managed using Git and Github. |[12. Covid-19](https://github.com/arlenesantos/Bootcamp-Projects/tree/main/12_Covid19) |
| Module 5  | PostgreSQL Database | In the PostgreSQL database / structured query language module, the relational data approach is presented. It is presented how to manage users, tables and databases from the PostgreSQL database engine, generating queries to extract information from tables and be able to process it, to solve problems and understand what transactionality is in databases using the DML language. Create conceptual, logical and physical models in order to add them to a database. Implement normalization techniques to reduce redundancy between tables and data duplication. |[13.

| Module 6  | Backend Development in Node | This module addresses develop backend web applications using Node and its characteristics for the construction of a server that manages files in a local directory and consults REST services from parameters received in HTTP queries. Building a CRUD application with the File System module. Implementing NPM packages (e.g. Yargs, Jimp, Axios, Nodemon, Nodemailer) in the development of a Node application to solve a given problem. Creating a server that provides a REST API for managing data stored in JSON files, considering the possible HTTP status errors that may occur between the communication of a client-server application. |[16.

| Module 7  | Access to Databases with Node.JS | In the Access to databases with Node module,  an REST API
is created to make the data available through a set of different routes. Requests are created, sending information via JSON to feed the parameterized queries, the results are manipulated in the backend before it's presented to the user. This workflow is orchestrated by async functions in the front end. Also, try catch blocks are used to execute SQL transactional operations and to treat errors when they occur. |[23.

| Module 8  | Express | Throughout the module the Express Framework is used, whose main goal is to facilitate the creation of web servers. In addition, express-handlebars is used for importing partials that use helpers for dynamic data rendering. Upload File functionality is also added to the backend using the express-fileupload package by hosting the files in a local directory. Finally, a REST API is created using the good practices defined by the REST standard and JWT is adopted for user authorization, improving the security of the resources made available in routes, returning custom messages and errors that include HTTP status codes. |[28.
